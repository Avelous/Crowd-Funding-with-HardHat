# FUND ME Repo

Repo goes through the creation of a Crowdfunding Project Built with Hardhat, Javascript and Solidity.

Two Smart Contracts were written 
1. **The FundMe Contract** Which gets funds from users and allows the deployer to withdraw the funds. User wallets are also stored in a mapping. This contract can be used in a presale

2. **The PriceConverter Contract**: Users fund in ETH of the equivalent USD value required. The price converter uses chainlink feeds to work this conversion.
